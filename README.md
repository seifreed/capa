# capa

The purpose of this repository it's to provide a dataset of MITRE ATT&CK techniques matching to specific malware families based on the tool capa.

I'll be updating the repository every time the tool it's updated with new techniques 

In case you find this information useful, please spread the word to have more people using this data.

I'll be adding new malware families for if someday is needed to use them in an academic way.

Special thanks to FireEye and their FLARE team to create and maintain Capa free of charge for the community
